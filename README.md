# Pygame-Interactive-Graph

# Objective
The goal of this project is to emulate the scatter pyplot from matplotlib in pygame. This requires plotting the data, generating graph elements, and creating interactable plot points. Furthermore, the end goal of this program is to make a simple way of generating plots to use in larger projects; with just the data and some settings, the program should be able to automatically generate an interactable graph in pygame.

# Controls
- WASD to pan the screen
- Right Click to pan the screen
- Left Click to see point data
- Scroll Wheel to zoom in or out

# Goals
- Display (x, y) on point hover
- Improve color scheme
- Improve legibility
- Add tick labels
- Add functions to autmate data handling from different files
- Add ui element transparency (pygame blending is expensive, so this may be omitted)

# Modules Used
- pygame
- csv
- os

# Acknowledgments
- This repository utilizes exo-planet data from NASA's exoplanet archive present [here](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/). I have uploaded an orginal copy of the data from the website and an edited copy used for the program.
