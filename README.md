# Pygame-Interactive-Graph

# Objective
The goal of this project is to emulate the scatter pyplot from matplotlib in pygame. This requires plotting the data, generating graph elements, and creating interactable plot points. Furthermore, the end goal of this program is to make a simple way of generating plots to use in larger projects; with just the data and some settings, the program should be able to automatically generate an interactable graph in pygame.
